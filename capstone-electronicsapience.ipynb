Rocks formed during these intervals are called chronostratigraphic units.\n *   The scale displays time chronologically, from the beginning of Earth's history to the present.\n\n ### Divisions of Geological Time (Largest to Smallest)\n\n *   **Eon:** The broadest category of geological time.\n *   **Era:** Eons are subdivided into eras.\n *   **Period:** Eras are subdivided into periods.\n *   **Epoch:** Periods are further divided into epochs.\n *   **Age:** Epochs are divided into ages.\n\n ### Eons\n\n *   Earth's history is characterized by four eons, from oldest to youngest:\n  *   Hadean\n  *   Archean\n  *   Proterozoic\n  *   Phanerozoic\n *   The Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic are collectively referred to as the \"Precambrian.\"\n *   The Phanerozoic Eon (meaning \"visible life\") is characterized by abundant, complex fossilized remains.\n\n ### Precambrian Eon\n\n *   The Precambrian spans from Earth's formation (around 4.6 billion years ago) to the beginning of the Cambrian Period (541 million years ago).\n *   It includes the Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic eons.\n *   The oldest rocks on Earth are Precambrian in age.\n *   Rocks from this time preserve evidence of early life forms at a microbial level.\n *   Fossils from this period are scarce and poorly preserved because organisms lacked hard parts.\n *   **Hadean Eon (4.5–4.0 billion years ago):**\n  *   Represents Earth's earliest history.\n  *   Characterized by a partially molten surface, volcanism, and asteroid impacts.\n  *   Very little evidence of this eon has survived.\n *   **Archean Eon (4.0–2.5 billion years ago):**\n  *   Life first appeared on Earth.\n  *   The earliest fossils are traces of microbial mats called stromatolites.\n *   **Proterozoic Eon (2.5 billion–541 million years ago):**\n  *   Multicellular organisms appeared late in this eon.\n  *   Ediacaran fauna, some of the earliest known multicellular animals, consisted of soft-bodied organisms.\n\n ### Phanerozoic Eon\n\n *   The Phanerozoic Eon (541 million years ago to today) is marked by an abundance of fossils.\n *   Organisms developed hard body parts (claws, scales, shells, bones) that were easily preserved.\n *   It is subdivided into three eras: Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic.\n\n #### Paleozoic Era (541 to 251.9 million years ago)\n\n *   The Paleozoic Era is divided into seven periods:\n  *   Cambrian\n  *   Ordovician\n  *   Silurian\n  *   Devonian\n  *   Mississippian\n  *   Pennsylvanian\n  *   Permian\n *   **Cambrian Period (541–485 million years ago):**\n  *   Marked by the Cambrian explosion, a rapid diversification of life.\n  *   Most marine animal phyla evolved.\n  *   The most common organisms were armored arthropods like trilobites.\n *   **Ordovician Period (485–444 million years ago):**\n  *   Many biological classes still prevalent today evolved, including primitive fish, cephalopods, and corals.\n  *   The first arthropods colonized the land.\n *   **Silurian Period (444–419 million years ago):**\n  *   Mass evolution of fish occurred.\n  *   The first freshwater fish evolved.\n  *   Fully terrestrial life evolved, including early arachnids, fungi, and centipedes.\n  *   Vascular plants began to colonize the land.\n *   **Devonian Period (419.2 to 358.9 MYA):**\n  *   Part of the \"Age of Fishes.\"\n *   **Mississippian Period (358.9 to 323.2 MYA):**\n  *   The first fully terrestrial tetrapods appeared.\n  *   Tetrapods evolved into amphibians and amniotes.\n *   **Pennsylvanian Period (323.2 to 298.9 MYA):**\n  *   Reptiles (amniotes) could live and reproduce entirely on land.\n  *   Extensive forests existed.\n *   **Permian Period (298.9 to 251.9 MYA):**\n  *   All continents came together to form the supercontinent Pangaea.\n  *   Reptiles flourished in the dry climate.\n  *   The Permian extinction, the greatest mass extinction in Earth's history, ended this era.\n\n #### Mesozoic Era (251.9 to 66.0 million years ago)\n\n *   The Mesozoic Era is divided into three periods:\n  *   Triassic\n  *   Jurassic\n  *   Cretaceous\n *   Often referred to as the \"Age of Reptiles\" or \"Age of Dinosaurs.\"\n *   Pangaea began separating into the modern continents.\n *   **Triassic Period (251.9 to 201.3 MYA):**\n  *   The first dinosaurs appeared.\n  *   Modern gymnosperms like conifers appeared.\n *   **Jurassic Period (201.3 to 145.0 MYA):**\n  *   Dinosaurs diversified.\n  *   The first birds evolved.\n *   **Cretaceous Period (145.0 to 66.0 MYA):**\n  *   The first flowering plants (angiosperms) appeared and diversified.\n  *   The Mesozoic Era ended with a major extinction event that led to the disappearance of most dinosaurs.\n\n #### Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago to today)\n\n *   The Cenozoic Era is divided into three periods:\n  *   Paleogene\n  *   Neogene\n  *   Quaternary\n *   Characterized by the dominance of mammals, insects, birds, and flowering plants.\n *   Often referred to as the \"Age of Mammals.\"\n *   **Paleogene Period (66.0 to 23.0 MYA):**\n  *   Mammals diversified rapidly after the extinction of the dinosaurs.\n  *   The first rodents, armadillos, and primitive primates appeared.\n *   **Neogene Period (23.0 to 2.58 MYA):**\n  *   Some of the finest fossils are found in this period.\n *   **Quaternary Period (2.58 MYA to Today):**\n  *   Massive ice sheets advanced and retreated across North America.\n  *   The Pleistocene Ice Ages occurred.\n  *   Modern humans evolved.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ls
